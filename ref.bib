abstract = {A smartphone-based head mounted display combined with a motion tracking device provides an affordable wireless interactive virtual reality system. A common problem of such a setup is high end-to-end latency. We evaluate low-cost motion trajectory prediction techniques and show that latency compensation can be realized without using much of the smartphone's computational resources. We apply the technique to reduce motion tracking lag in a smartphone-based virtual reality lightsaber fighting game.},
